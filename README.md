# LTServer
Learner Tracker System Server

### What is it?
----
This is the server side of a tracking system for students. Students swipe their
RFID enabled keycard, and this updates their current position, which is then
made avaliable to teachers.

### How do I use it?
----
You don't. It's insecure(not unlike myself), and really is just supposed to show
people looking at my profile that I can mostly cobble something together that
mostly works.

### TODO
----
*Make a better project so this doesn't have to be the thing that I show people
